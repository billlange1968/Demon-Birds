<h2>Altirra Notes</h2>
The Action source code has been modified to remove unprintable ATASCII characters, control characters, and inverse characters. They have been replaced with printable ATASCII character codes. You can copy the source code directly from Github and paste it into the Action Editor in Altirra. Make sure toggle off CAPS LOCK so that the source code is pasted into Altirra with mix upper and lower case characters. If CAPS LOCK is enabled, all lower case characters will be pasted in as upper case. Also, make sure to put Altirra into WARP SPEED mode so that the paste process is quick, then turn off WARP SPEED.

<p>You are the last Wizard of Akturnis, the strange and mystical world where magic can be worked by anyone with the will to do so. But, in the past few years, people have lost their faith in Wizards and magic. Now the evil <strong>Demon Birds</strong> have begun to plague them, and you are their <i>only</i> hope.</p>

<p>To save the People or Akturnis, you must enter the dreaded Valley of Death and destroy all of the <strong>Demon Birds</strong> found there.</p>

<p>Your Wizard starts the game with four lives and fifty units of energy. For every bird you destroy, you will gain two units of energy. However, every time you cast a fireball, you <i>lose</i> one unit of energy.</p>

<p>You move your Wizard left and right at the bottom of the screen, using the joystick. You may cast a fireball by pressing the red button while moving in the direction in which you wish it to travel.</p>

<p>Ridding your people of the <strong>Demon Birds</strong> will not be easy. If you are struck by one of the evil birds, or are hit by a meteor from the sky, you will lose one life. You'll also lose a life if your energy reaches zero. Furthermore, the ground in the valley is very unstable, because it sits on top of a pool of lava. If you stand in one place for too long, the ground will open up, and your Wizard will be lost.</p>
