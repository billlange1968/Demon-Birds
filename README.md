<p>You are the last Wizard of Akturnis, the strange and mystical world where magic can be worked by anyone with the will to do so. But, in the past few years, people have lost their faith in Wizards and magic. Now the evil <strong>Demon Birds</strong> have begun to plague them, and you are their <i>only</i> hope.</p>

<p>To save the People or Akturnis, you must enter the dreaded Valley of Death and destroy all of the <strong>Demon Birds</strong> found there.</p>

<p>Your Wizard starts the game with four lives and fifty units of energy. For every bird you destroy, you will gain two units of energy. However, every time you cast a fireball, you <i>lose</i> one unit of energy.</p>

<p>You move your Wizard left and right at the bottom of the screen, using the joystick. You may cast a fireball by pressing the red button while moving in the direction in which you wish it to travel.</p>

<p>Ridding your people of the <strong>Demon Birds</strong> will not be easy. If you are struck by one of the evil birds, or are hit by a meteor from the sky, you will lose one life. You'll also lose a life if your energy reaches zero. Furthermore, the ground in the valley is very unstable, because it sits on top of a pool of lava. If you stand in one place for too long, the ground will open up, and your Wizard will be lost.</p>
